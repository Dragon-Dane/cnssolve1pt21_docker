# cnssolve1pt21_docker

Dockerfile to build images that will compile CNSsolve 1.21 (need old version for ultimately working with software at http://aria.pasteur.fr/supplementary-data/x-links)  
NOTE: THE FILE `cns_solve_1.21_all-mp.tar.gz` MUST BE PROVIDED, SEE BELOW. This Dockerfile will handle everything else to result in a freshly compiled version that will run.
